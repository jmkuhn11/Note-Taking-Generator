# Note-Taking-Generator

## Description

I am a very busy student juggling my course load along with my job. I need to make my schedule more organized so I can get everything done in a timely manner without forgetting. Thus, I decided to make a note taking generator that will keep my activities documented. By creating this application, I am starting to have a better understanding of how express works in json, how to use my computer as a server, and how to link/route/path multiple js files so all can run off of just the server.js file. This is helping me achieve my goal of organizing and sending data when clients and my server communicate theorugh requests and responses.

## Installation

Install node.js for your VSC, and then incorprate express and uuid as dependencies in the terminal on node.js

##Usage

A user will open the application to the home page, prompting them to make a new note. Upon clicking that button, they will be taken to the note-taking page. All previous notes that have yet to be completed will be listed in a column on the left-hand side. There will then be a place to put your note title and your note description in the middle of the page. Once finished writing, you can click the save button in the top right of the page to add the note to the saved note column. If you want to view a note in the center of the page, just click on it from the left-hand column. If you complete that note, hit the corresponding trash can button to delete it. If you are viewing a note and want to write a new one, click the plus icon in the top right to start wrtiting again.
